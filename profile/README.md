  * **Surgical Precision Aimbot (Adaptive & Ballistic Smart):** Command every shot with devastating accuracy, turning any weapon into a precision instrument.
      * **Humanized Aiming:** Adjustable smoothness, customizable FOV, and intelligent aim movement mimic natural player actions, ensuring your shots look legitimate and evade detection.
      * **Bone Priority:** Configure targeting to specific body parts (e.g., head for instant kills, chest for consistent damage) to optimize your engagements.

  * **Stamina-Independent Aiming:** Maintain perfect aim stability regardless of your character's stamina level or movement, eliminating the need to prone or rest to steady your shots.
  * **Customizable Hotkeys & Profiles:** Tailor every feature to your playstyle, switching between "Legit Aim" for competitive play and "Ragebot" for pure mayhem (PvE/unranked) with instant hotkeys. Create and save multiple configurations for different weapons or combat roles.
  * **EAC Stealth Protocol:** Engineered with the absolute latest anti-detection methods, our aimbot operates discreetly at a kernel level, keeping you completely safe from Easy Anti-Cheat's vigilant scans.
